# Name Five!
Name Five is a game where you need to list words that belong to a specific category, with 3 of each letter available to use. Guessing correctly replenishes your letters randomly, but each letter is differently weighted (e.g. you're more likely to get back an E than a J). Here's an example:
> Oh you like seeing? Name five colors!
> red
> orange
> yellow
> pink
> gray
Name Five was inspired by what annoying people say when you wear a band's shirt.
